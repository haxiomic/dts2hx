		This should be a complete, valid html document. Changing this property causes the webview to be reloaded.
		
		Webviews are sandboxed from normal extension process, so all communication with the webview must use
		message passing. To send a message from the extension to the webview, use [`postMessage`](#Webview.postMessage).
		To send message from the webview back to an extension, use the `acquireVsCodeApi` function inside the webview
		to get a handle to VS Code's api and then call `.postMessage()`:
		
		```html
		<script>
		     const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi(); // acquireVsCodeApi can only be invoked once
		     vscode.postMessage({ message: 'hello!' });
		</script>
		```
		
		To load a resources from the workspace inside a webview, use the `[asWebviewUri](#Webview.asWebviewUri)` method
		and ensure the resource's directory is listed in [`WebviewOptions.localResourceRoots`](#WebviewOptions.localResourceRoots).
		
		Keep in mind that even though webviews are sandboxed, they still allow running scripts and loading arbitrary content,
		so extensions must follow all standard web security best practices when working with webviews. This includes
		properly sanitizing all untrusted input (including content from the workspace) and
		setting a [content security policy](https://aka.ms/vscode-api-webview-csp).
