/**
	jQuery's event system normalizes the event object according to W3C standards. The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler (no checks for window.event required). It normalizes the target, relatedTarget, which, metaKey and pageX/Y properties and provides both stopPropagation() and preventDefault() methods.
	
	Those properties are all documented, and accompanied by examples, on the \`{@link http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ Event object}\` page.
	
	The standard events in the Document Object Model are: `blur`, `focus`, `load`, `resize`, `scroll`, `unload`, `beforeunload`, `click`, `dblclick`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mousemove`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, `change`, `select`, `submit`, `keydown`, `keypress`, and `keyup`. Since the DOM event names have predefined meanings for some elements, using them for other purposes is not recommended. jQuery's event model can trigger an event by any name on an element, and it is propagated up the DOM tree to which that element belongs, if any.
